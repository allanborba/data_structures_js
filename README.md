## Data structure repository in Javascript

*This repository was created for educational purposes*

This project is a summary of studies on data structure. Classes were created for most used data structures that are not native in js. In each class was added structure behavior.


### 100% test coverage.

This project is TDD approved :heavy_check_mark:.
Although the focus of this study was not the tests, they were used to facilitate the writing and verification of each structure.

The following structures are included in the repository:
- Linked list;
- Double linked list (which inherits from linked list);
- Stack;
- Queue;
- Graph;
- Digraph (which inherits from graph);
- Binarytree;

The code was written to be as simple and explicit as possible. All data structures cover most of their functions. Traversing, insertion and removal of elements. Each with their characteristics.

Each data structure aimed at the best possible performance for its methods. Emphasis was placed on the Big-O without running away from good readability.
